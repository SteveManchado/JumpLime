# **JumpLime 🟢**

**Portfolio Demo — Web Game built with Godot Engine** 🎮

## **📝 Project Overview**

JumpLime is a browser-based game fully developed by me — including both artwork and programming.  
This project is not intended as a commercial release but rather as a portfolio showcase, highlighting skills in game development, physics programming, and web deployment using Godot Engine 3.5 Stable.

## **👾 How to Play**

* **Movement** ⬅️➡️:  
  * The slime can only move **left and right while in the air** (falling or jumping).  
* **Jumping** 🔼:  
  * Jumps have **three power levels**, depending on how long the jump key is held.  
  * A **power indicator** appears in the bottom-right corner.  
  * The slime also **changes color**: red indicates maximum jump strength.  
* **Physics** 🧪:  
  * The slime has **soft, slippery physics**.  
  * It can **slide off ledges**, so precise landings are recommended.  
* **Objective** 🏆:  
  * Keep climbing by landing on platforms.  

## **💻 Technologies Used**

* **Godot Engine 3.5 Stable** — game development.  
* **HTML / JavaScript / WebAssembly (WASM)** — web execution.

## **📂 Repository Contents**

* index.html — Entry point for the game.  
* index.js — JavaScript bridge for WASM integration.  
* index.wasm & index.pck — Godot export package files.
